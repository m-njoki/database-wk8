# Student Records Management System

 Project Title: College Database Management System

# Description of the Project:

This project is a College Database Management System that helps manage student records for a college or university. The database structure is designed to handle the following components:

1. Departments: A list of all academic departments in the college.
2. Professors: Information about faculty members, including their name, email, and department.
3. Students: Details about the students, including personal information, department, and gender.
4. Courses: A catalog of courses offered by the college, along with the professors teaching them.
5. Enrollments: Tracks which students are enrolled in which courses.
6. Grades: Stores the grades awarded to students for their courses.

Additionally, the system supports many-to-many relationships for courses and students, ensuring a student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have many students.
